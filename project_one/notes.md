1. Frontend is really nice, well organized.
2. In the models would like there to be more aggregate methods (eg. group by, etc.)  
* We'll see more ideas for this as we progress through the course.
3. Try adding some tests.
4. Use a manage.py file (see my code as an example).

Overall, the code you have here is really clean.  I think the biggest missing piee is (1) tests 
(2) aggregate query methods (or some sort of custom sql)
Stylistically, the only thing to change is to have better names when iterating  (see the builder.py file where I made comments.)
